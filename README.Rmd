<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of {nettskjemar} is to have easy access to data and form information on the [Nettskjema](https://nettskjema.no/) service by the [University of Oslo, Norway](https://www.uio.no/english/).
Currently the main possibilities is help in creating users and tokens for accessing Nettskjema through its API, downloading meta-data and codebooks about specific forms and data associated with a specific form.

Install the released version from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("nettskjemar")
```

Newer releases can be installed through the authors r-universe:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Enable this universe
options(repos = c(
    athanasiamo = 'https://athanasiamo.r-universe.dev',
    CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))

# Install some packages
install.packages('nettskjemar')
```


Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("LCBC-UiO/nettskjemar")
```

## Setting up the authentication
There is a tutorial on [how to create the API access user and token](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/nettskjemar/articles/auth_setup.html) needed to work with the api.
This will need to be completed before you can access any other features of this package.

## Example

Currently, the package contains functions to download data from forms, including submission answers, meta-data and codebook information.
The most important, is the function that will download nettskjema submission data and return them as a tibble (data.frame). 
This needs only the _id_ of a nettskjema, which can be found in the last part of the nettskjema url.

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(nettskjemar)

nettskjema_get_data(nettskjema_id)
```

If you do not have the codebook activated, or you want to use the full answers to questions rather than the coded ones, you can toggle off code book answers:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nettskjema_get_data(nettskjema_id, use_codebook = FALSE)
```


## Documentation
Package documentation can be found on the associated [GitHub pages](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/nettskjemar/), among other documentation on [how to create the API acces user and token](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/nettskjemar/articles/auth_setup.html).
