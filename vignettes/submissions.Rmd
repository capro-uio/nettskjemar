# Overview

This vignette demonstrates how to handle form submissions and answers using the Nettskjema API.
Specifically, you will learn how to:
1. Get an individual submission answer.
1. Download an individual submission as a PDF.

# Getting an Individual Submission Answer: `ns_get_submission`

The `ns_get_submission` function fetches a single submission's answers based on a **submission ID**.

## Example: Fetch an Individual Submission

To retrieve an individual submission, use the **submission ID** (a unique identifier for each submission).

```r
# Replace with your submission ID
submission_id <- 27685292

# Get the submission data
submission <- ns_get_submission(submission_id)

# Display the submission data
submission
```

This function returns a list containing all answers for the specified submission.
