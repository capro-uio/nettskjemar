# Overview

Nettskjema allows users to upload attachments with their form submissions. This vignette explains how to use the functions provided in this package to list, retrieve, and save these attachments efficiently.

# Listing Attachments

Before downloading any attachments, it's useful to list the available files.

## Listing attachments for a specific submission

Each submission ID may have associated attachments. Use `ns_list_submission_attachments()` to retrieve information about the available attachments.


``` r
library(nettskjemar)
# Example: List attachments for a specific submission
submission_id <- 27685292
ns_list_submission_attachments(submission_id)
#>   submissionId  answerId elementId externalElementId
#> 1     27685292 158263134   1641713      attachment_1
#>   textAnswer answerAttachmentId  filename mediaType   size
#> 1  sølvi.png             538819 sølvi.png image/png 628613
#>   elementType attachment.answerAttachmentId
#> 1  ATTACHMENT                        538819
#>   attachment.filename attachment.mediaType attachment.size
#> 1           sølvi.png            image/png          628613
#>   counter
#> 1       1
```

This function returns a `data.frame` with details such as the attachment ID, original filename, and standardized filename.

## Listing all attachments for a form

To list all attachments across multiple submissions for a form, use `ns_list_form_attachments()`.


``` r
# Example: List attachments for an entire form
formid <- 123823
ns_list_form_attachments(formid)
#>    formid formId submissionId  answerId elementId
#> 16 123823 123823     27685292 158263134   1641713
#> 32 123823 123823     27685302 158263185   3525020
#>    externalElementId  textAnswer answerOptionIds
#> 16      attachment_1   sølvi.png                
#> 32      attachment_2 marius.jpeg                
#>    externalAnswerOptionIds elementType         createdDate
#> 16                          ATTACHMENT 2023-06-01T20:57:15
#> 32                          ATTACHMENT 2023-06-01T20:58:33
#>           modifiedDate subElementId answerAttachmentId
#> 16 2023-06-01T20:57:15           NA             538819
#> 32 2023-06-01T20:58:33           NA             538820
#>       filename  mediaType   size
#> 16   sølvi.png  image/png 628613
#> 32 marius.jpeg image/jpeg  89494
#>    attachment.answerAttachmentId attachment.filename
#> 16                        538819           sølvi.png
#> 32                        538820         marius.jpeg
#>    attachment.mediaType attachment.size counter
#> 16            image/png          628613       1
#> 32           image/jpeg           89494       1
```

# Downloading Attachments

Once you have identified the attachments, you can download them using `ns_get_attachment()`.

```r
# Example: Download a single attachment
attachment_id <- "12345"
ns_get_attachment(attachment_id, path = "downloaded_file.pdf")
```

If `path` is not provided, the function returns the response object without saving the file.

# Saving All Attachments

## For a Single Submission

Use `ns_get_submission_attachments()` to download and save all attachments associated with a single submission.

```r
# Example: Save all attachments for a submission
ns_get_submission_attachments(submission_id)
```

This function supports two filename conventions:

- **"standardized"** (default): Creates filenames based on submission ID and a counter.
- **"original"**: Uses the filenames as they were uploaded.

To save attachments using the original filenames:

```r
ns_get_submission_attachments(submission_id, filenames = "original")
```

You can also specify an output directory:

```r
ns_get_submission_attachments(submission_id, output_dir = "my_attachments/")
```

## For an Entire Form

To download and save all attachments from a form:

```r
ns_get_form_attachments(formid)
```

As with submission attachments, you can specify a filename format and output directory:

```r
ns_get_form_attachments(formid, filenames = "original", output_dir = "all_attachments/")
```

# Summary

This vignette demonstrated how to:
- List attachments for submissions and forms.
- Retrieve individual attachments.
- Save attachments using different naming conventions.

By using these functions, you can efficiently manage Nettskjema file attachments within your R workflow.
