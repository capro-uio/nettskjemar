This vignette explains how to set up authentication with the Nettskjema API using the `ns_req` and `ns_auth_token` functions provided in the package.
Authentication is required to connect to the API endpoints and perform operations.

## Setting Up Authentication

### Setting up a client

Before using the functions, you need the following:
1. **A registered API client** in Nettskjema.
2. **Your client credentials** (client ID and client secret). These are provided when you register the client.

To register a client go to the [nettskjema authorization portal](https://authorization.nettskjema.no/) or use the `ns_create_client()` function to open the url.
Here you will be asked to log in with your user account, so you can create the client.


### Add Credentials to Your `.Renviron` File

To prevent hardcoding your credentials in your scripts, add the following entries to your `.Renviron` file. 
The `.Renviron` file is a hidden file in your home directory that R reads on startup.

1. Open your `.Renviron` file. You can create or edit it with:

```r
file.edit(fs::path_home(".Renviron"))
```

2. Add your credentials:

```
NETTSKJEMA_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
NETTSKJEMA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

Replace `your_client_id` and `your_client_secret` with the actual values you received from Nettskjema.

3. Save and close the file.

4. Restart your R session to the load changes.

### Retrieve the Access Token

Use the `ns_auth_token` function to retrieve your access token. 
This function exchanges your client credentials for a valid token. The token is cached by default for efficiency.

```{r auth-me}
library(nettskjemar)

# Try getting your user information
ns_get_me()
```

If this returns a data.frame of all the forms this client has access to.

By default, the token is stored in your home directory as `.nettskjema_token.rds` with a 24-hour validity period (max validity of a token).
The token is automatically refreshed after the 24--hour period is over, and you as a user should not even notice that this happens.

You can configure the caching path using the `cache_path` argument of the function, if you are comfortable doing that.

### Accessing forms

To access forms, you need to add the client to each form you want it to have access to.
This is similar to the procedures necessary in api v2, for those who had experience with that.

There is a table with "My clients", with the header row: Client Id, Username, Client Name, Created and Expires, with three dots at the end for more options. The client id is a SHA hash, and the username is the same SHA has appended with @apiclient.](static/client_overview.png)

You will need to go to each Nettskjema forms `Settings -> Permissions -> Editing permissions` and add the client id in the username format `<cliendId>@apiclient` to every form you want this specific client to have access to.

This means you can create custom clients with specific user access to particular forms, rather than having a single client with overall access to everything you have access to.
While this creates an initial burden of set up, it also allows more control and granularity for security.

### Renewing the client

The client is valid for one year, at which point you will need to renew it for it to continue working.
Reneweing means getting a new secret, not a whole new client, meaning the client will retain access to all the forms you have added it to, and you won't need to re-do that part of the work.

To renew the client, go to the [authorization portal](https://authorization.nettskjema.no/), and click the three dots next to the client you want to renew, and choose "Renew".
You will then get a new secret, which you will need to add to you .Renviron file, [like before](#add-credentials-to-your--renviron-file), by replacing the one you already have there.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Invalid Credentials**: Ensure your client ID and client secret are correct and have been properly registered in Nettskjema.
2. **Token Expiry**: Tokens are valid for 24 hours by default. Re-run `ns_auth_token` to refresh the token, though this should generally not be necessary, as it is run in the background.
3. **Environment Variables Not Loaded**: Ensure you've added your credentials to `.Renviron` and restarted your R session, the last part is necessary for R to access the new information.
